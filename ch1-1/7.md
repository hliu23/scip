The old test does not work for very small numbers because it allows an error inside the range of 0.001, which can make a large difference if the square root of a very small number is being calculated.  
The old test does not work for very large numbers <s>because the limited precision of calculations causes the interpreter to ignore difference as large as 500 between intended result and actual result.</s> because rounding errors can cause the difference between expected and actual value to stay above 0.001. ([Reference](https://codology.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-7/))  
This works better for large and small numbers because it matches precision to the size of the result needed.
